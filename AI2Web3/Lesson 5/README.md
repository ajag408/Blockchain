# Lesson 05: Project Building Guidelines

In this lesson we'll cover all you need to know about building and deploying your project, from idea to production.

We'll explain the process and techniques that we use in the professionals projects that we build in our Software Factory, and how these have helped many previous students to build their projects with success, winning grants, hackathon bounties, prizes, and even getting jobs at top tech companies.

## Deploying Applications to a Decentralized Infrastructure

- Hosting applications
- Frontend and backend integration
- Databases
- Web3 integration

## Project Building Guidelines

- Major problems:
  - Bad coordination
    - Your biggest enemy
  - Bad idea
    - Hidden threat that can take you by surprise
  - Bad (technical) execution
    - A relatively smaller problem
    - What most people focus on

### Solving Coordination Problems

1. Team formation
2. Planning
3. Communication

### Solving Ideation Problems

1. Technical ideation vs Business ideation
2. Prototyping and the importance of a lean MVP
3. Listening to feedback carefully

### Solving Execution Problems

1. Architecture and documentation
2. Execution planning and monitoring
3. Presentation and delivery

## Project Building Exercise

- Form groups of 2-5 people
- Compose a project idea together
- Create a GitHub repository for the project
- Create a README.md file for the project
  - Write down a very short description of the project
- Create a plan for the project
  - Write down the steps to complete the project in a WIP (Work In Progress) Pull Request
- Implement the project with your team
- Try to come up with a working demo of your project within the first one hour of your project building session
- Demonstrate the project to groups nearby to validate the idea
  - Show as much as possible, tell as little as possible, and ask the impressions from the audience

## Next Steps

- Join the community
- Attend future events
- Enroll in more bootcamps
- Attend hackathons
- Apply for grants/prizes
- Apply for jobs
- Enjoy the sponsor's perks for this bootcamp
